# Dog vs Cat Classification using Transfer Learning
# Overview

This project classifies images of dogs and cats using a pre-trained deep learning model (Transfer Learning). It leverages models like ResNet50, VGG16, or InceptionV3 to achieve high accuracy with minimal training time.

# Features

Image preprocessing and data augmentation.

Transfer Learning using pre-trained CNN architectures.

Fine-tuning for improved performance.

Visualization of training accuracy, loss, and predictions.

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries & Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

# How It Works

Load and preprocess the dataset (resize images, normalize pixels).

Use a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50) as a base.

Add custom classification layers for binary output (Dog or Cat).

Train and fine-tune the model using Transfer Learning.

Evaluate accuracy and test on new images.

Usage
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dog-vs-Cat-TransferLearning.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd Dog-vs-Cat-TransferLearning

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the training script
python train_model.py

# Results

Achieved high accuracy with reduced training time.

Correctly classifies unseen images of dogs and cats.

# Future Enhancements

Deploy as a web application or mobile app.

Add multi-class classification for other animals.

Improve real-time prediction with TensorFlow Lite or ONNX.
